function [Cell] = ConvertDAQ(Cell)
% This function corrects the import from igor for when there are multiple
% sampling frequencies. 

%                   INPUT/OUTPUT
% Input:  A cell that has been imported from Igor, which has multiple
% sampling frequencies
% Output: Corrected Cell.data and Cell.comm, which are matrices in which
% each column is a sweep. Number of rows = number of points for maximum
% number of samples

%                   ASSUMPTIONS
% This assumes that that ONLY the sampling frequency changes between
% sweeps.
%

% Determine the total number of sweeps as well as the maximum Fs (DAQ) -
% these determine the size of the data and command matrices.
